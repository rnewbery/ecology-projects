# Ecological Projects

This repository contains a collection of small and long-term ecology and wildlife data projects I have undertaken independently.  
It highlights analytical and visual projects developed using **R, Python, and SQL** - each grounded in real ecological data.

## Featured Projects

- [**Wetland Bird Trends Analysis**](./wetland-bird-survey)  
  Data cleaning, summary statistics, species abundance, Shannon Diversity calculations, habitat-level summaries, and dashboard visualisations.

- [**Butterfly Survey (Phase 1 Hab)**](./butterfly_survey)
   Exploratory analysis of butterfly abundance and richness at a SSSI Nature Reserve in Surrey.
   *Skills:* SQL (PostgreSQL), QGIS

- [**Garden Birdwatch Summary**](./garden-birdwatch-summary)  
  Python script automating the categorisation and summary of bird survey data.  
  *Skills:* Python scripting, data categorisation, text file output, Git versioning.

- [**Tree Survey Data Analysis**](./tree-survey-data)  
  Exploratory analysis of tree species, canopy cover, and site conditions.  
  *Skills:* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), ecological data summaries, visual reporting.

- [**Western Kingbird Analysis**](./western-kingbird-analysis)  
  Statistical comparison of morphometric traits across populations using R.  
  *Skills:* GLM, ANOVA, data visualisation, reproducible workflows.

## About

I’m currently completing an **MSc in Wildlife Biology & Conservation** while developing analytical projects with a range of courses that blend ecological field data with data science tools.  
My work bridges conservation and analytics - from species survey data in R and Python to dashboards that communicate biodiversity insights clearly and accessibly.
